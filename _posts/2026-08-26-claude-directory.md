Where Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md, settings.json, hooks, skills, commands, subagents, workflows, rules, and auto memory. Explore the .claude directory in your project and ~/.claude in your home directory.

Claude Code reads instructions, settings, skills, subagents, and memory from your project directory and from `~/.claude` in your home directory. Commit project files to git to share them with your team; files in `~/.claude` are personal configuration that applies across all your projects.

On Windows, `~/.claude` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`. If you set [`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](/docs/en/env-vars), every `~/.claude` path on this page lives under that directory instead.

Most users only edit `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json`. The rest of the directory is optional: add skills, rules, or subagents as you need them.

## Explore the directory

Click files in the tree to see what each one does, when it loads, and an example.

## What's not shown

The explorer covers files you author and edit. A few related files live elsewhere:

| File                    | Location                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `managed-settings.json` | System-level, varies by OS | Enterprise-enforced settings that you can't override, apart from [narrow exceptions](/docs/en/settings#security-keys-where-the-stricter-value-applies). See [where to save the file](/docs/en/managed-settings#deploy-a-managed-settings-file) and [which managed source Claude Code uses](/docs/en/managed-settings#precedence-within-the-managed-tier).                                                                                                                          |
| `CLAUDE.local.md`       | Project root               | Your private preferences for this project, loaded alongside CLAUDE.md. Create it manually and add it to `.gitignore`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Installed plugins       | `~/.claude/plugins`        | Cloned marketplaces, installed plugin versions, and per-plugin data, managed by `claude plugin` commands. For a plugin installed from a marketplace [`command` source](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#command-sources) in link mode, Claude Code stores links here instead of a copy, and the plugin's files stay in the directory the command prints. See [plugin caching](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution) for how orphaned versions are cleaned up. |

`~/.claude` also holds data Claude Code writes as you work: transcripts, prompt history, file snapshots, caches, and logs. See [application data](#application-data) below.

## Choose the right file

Different kinds of customization live in different files. Use this table to find where a change belongs.

## File reference

This table lists every file the explorer covers. Project-scope files live in your repo under `.claude/` (or at the root for `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, and `.worktreeinclude`). Global-scope files live in `~/.claude/` and apply across all projects.

  Several things can override what you put in these files:

  * [Managed settings](/docs/en/server-managed-settings) deployed by your organization take precedence over everything, apart from the [exceptions under Settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#exceptions-to-managed-settings-precedence)
  * CLI flags like `--permission-mode` or `--settings` override `settings.json` for that session
  * Some environment variables take precedence over their equivalent setting, but this varies: check the [environment variables reference](/docs/en/env-vars) for each one

  See [settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence) for the full order.

## Troubleshoot configuration

If a setting, hook, or file isn't taking effect, see [Debug your configuration](/docs/en/debug-your-config) for the inspection commands and a symptom-first lookup table.

## Application data

Beyond the config you author, `~/.claude` holds data Claude Code writes during sessions. These files are plaintext. Anything that passes through a tool lands in a transcript on disk: file contents, command output, pasted text.

### Cleaned up automatically

Claude Code deletes the files in the paths below once they're older than [`cleanupPeriodDays`](/docs/en/settings-reference#cleanupperioddays), as long as it can safely determine the retention period. The default is 30 days and the minimum is 1; setting `0` fails with a validation error. The same age cutoff applies to automatic removal of [orphaned worktrees](/docs/en/worktrees#clean-up-subagent-and-background-session-worktrees).

| Path under `~/.claude/`                      | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Claude Code makes four exceptions to this sweep:

* **`sessions/`**: holds one small file per running session, used to detect concurrent sessions and crashes. It isn't part of the age-based sweep: Claude Code removes each file when its session exits and clears crash leftovers on the next launch.
* **Auto memory**: Claude Code excludes a project's [auto memory](/docs/en/memory#auto-memory) directory, `projects/<project>/memory/`, from this sweep, and removes the directory itself only after it has been empty for the whole retention period. Before v2.1.228, the sweep treated folders inside the memory directory as session data and could delete old files beneath it.
* **Bare mode**: when you run `claude -p` with [`--bare`](/docs/en/headless#start-faster-with-bare-mode), Claude Code doesn't run the sweep in that session.
* **Paused sweep**: if Claude Code can't safely determine the retention period, it pauses the retention cleanup sweep; the [`retention_sweep` event](/docs/en/monitoring-usage#retention-sweep-event) lists each configuration that pauses it. When the cause is a settings file that can't be read or parsed, or settings errors with `cleanupPeriodDays` explicitly set, Claude Code also shows a warning in `/status` until you fix the settings errors. When [managed settings](/docs/en/server-managed-settings) provide `cleanupPeriodDays`, Claude Code runs the sweep at the managed value in either case.

### Kept until you delete them

The retention cleanup sweep doesn't cover the following paths. Claude Code keeps them until you delete them, apart from the two caches whose rows say that logging out deletes them.

| Path under `~/.claude/` | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history.jsonl`         | Every prompt you've typed, with timestamp and project path.

| `remote-settings.json`  | Cached copy of [server-managed settings](/docs/en/server-managed-settings) for your organization, or `{}` when your organization has configured none. Only present when the session [fetches them](/docs/en/server-managed-settings#platform-availability). Claude Code checks for updates at startup and hourly during a session. Claude Code deletes it when you log out. |
| `cache/changelog.md`    | Cached copy of the Claude Code changelog, used to show release notes after an update. Refreshed in the background.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `policy-limits.json`    | Cached feature policy settings for your organization. Only present for some account types. Refreshed automatically. Claude Code deletes it when you log out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Other small cache and lock files appear depending on which features you use and are safe to delete.

### Plaintext storage

Transcripts and history are not encrypted at rest. OS file permissions are the only protection. If a tool reads a `.env` file or a command prints a credential, that value is written to `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`. To reduce exposure:

* Lower `cleanupPeriodDays` to shorten how long transcripts are kept
* Set the [`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY`](/docs/en/env-vars) environment variable to skip writing transcripts and prompt history in any mode. In non-interactive mode, you can instead pass `--no-session-persistence` alongside `-p`, or set `persistSession: false` in the TypeScript Agent SDK; the Python SDK has no equivalent option.
* Use [permission rules](/docs/en/permissions) to deny reads of credential files

### Clear local data

Run `claude project purge` to delete the state Claude Code holds for one project. It deletes:

* Transcripts and auto memory under `projects/`
* Per-session `tasks/`, `debug/`, and `file-history/` entries
* Matching prompt lines in `history.jsonl`
* The project's entry in `~/.claude.json`

The command prints the full deletion plan and asks for confirmation before removing anything.

The examples below use `~/work/my-repo` as a placeholder. Replace it with the path to your project. If no state matches the path, the command prints an error and exits with status 1.

Preview the plan without deleting anything:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo --dry-run
```

The plan lists each matching item and why it is included:

```text theme={null}
Purge plan for /home/user/work/my-repo:

  dir:    /home/user/.claude/projects/-home-user-work-my-repo
           project transcripts (.jsonl) and memory/
  config: projects["/home/user/work/my-repo"]
           project entry in ~/.claude.json (trust, history, MCP servers)
  filter: /home/user/.claude/history.jsonl
           12 prompt(s) typed in this project

shell-snapshots/ are not project-scoped and will not be touched
backups/ may still contain this project entry in old .claude.json snapshots (/home/user/.claude/backups); at most 5 are kept and they rotate out automatically
Dry run: 3 item(s) would be deleted.
```

Delete with a single confirmation prompt:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo
```

The command prints the same plan, then asks `Delete 3 item(s) for /home/user/work/my-repo? This cannot be undone. [y/N]` and deletes only if you answer `y`.

Omit the path to pick a project from an interactive list.

Skip the confirmation prompt for use in scripts:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo --yes
```

Pass `--all` instead of a path to purge state for every project at once, which deletes `history.jsonl` outright rather than filtering it. Pass `-i` to step through the deletion plan one item at a time.

The command leaves `shell-snapshots/` and `backups/` alone because those are not project-scoped, and warns about them in the plan output.

You can also delete any of the application-data paths above by hand. New sessions are unaffected. The table below shows what you lose for past sessions.
